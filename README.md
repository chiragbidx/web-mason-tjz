# Next.js App Router Boilerplate — Operational Guide

This repository is a minimal Next.js 16 (App Router) starter with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind-ready PostCSS, and **Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL ready**. Auth deps are present (NextAuth), but routes/config are not wired. Use this document as the single operational reference. If anything is unclear: **STOP AND ASK** before proceeding.

---

## 1. Current Scope
- Purpose: baseline UI scaffold with Postgres-backed Drizzle schema and auth-ready dependencies.
- Data: Drizzle configured for PostgreSQL; base `users` model (email, first/last name, password hash, emailVerified, timestamps) with migration in `drizzle/`.
- Auth: NextAuth.js installed; no routes/config wired yet.
- AI integration default: OpenAI with model `gpt-4o-mini` (override via `OPENAI_MODEL`).
- Env vars: `env.example` lists `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (reuse `AUTH_SECRET`), and `BASE_URL` (use as NextAuth’s canonical URL instead of `NEXTAUTH_URL`).
- Current landing: Panda-themed orange palette composed of modular sections (hero with parallax orbs, logo marquee, features, metrics, pricing, security, docs/support, legal, CTA). Layout is responsive with wrapping buttons and a max width ~1600px.
- Client interactivity is isolated to small islands (hero `HeroOrbs` parallax; `AgentActionPanel` stub exists but is not rendered on the landing).

## First Request Rule
- Ship the first feature directly in `app/page.tsx` before adding new routes or structure.
- Build the requested feature end to end with production-ready integration (AI/dataflow/API/UX). Keep the client island (e.g., `ContractAIDemo` with `"use client"`) handling interactivity while the rest of the landing stays server-rendered and performant.
- Once the production-grade feature works, rebrand the entire page — header, hero, body, footer — to match the feature; polish visuals after functionality is solid.

## 2. Technology Stack
- Next.js 16 App Router (server-first, file-based routing).
- React 19, TypeScript 5 (strict).
- Styling: Tailwind via `@tailwindcss/postcss` pipeline; global CSS in `app/globals.css`.
- Data: Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL (schema + migration present).
- Auth deps present: `next-auth` (not yet configured).
- Tooling: ESLint 9 (`eslint-config-next`), PostCSS. Geist fonts removed from layout for offline-safe builds.

## 3. Project Structure
```
app/
  layout.tsx        # Root layout, loads fonts, applies globals
  page.tsx          # Public landing page that composes modular sections
  globals.css       # Global styles; Tailwind entrypoint

eslint.config.mjs   # ESLint configuration
next.config.ts      # Next.js config (minimal)
postcss.config.mjs  # PostCSS plugins (Tailwind-ready)
tsconfig.json       # TypeScript config
package.json        # Scripts and dependencies
package-lock.json   # Locked dependency tree
FILES.md            # Structural index
RULES.md            # Change boundaries (boilerplate)
```

## 4. Install & Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # starts Next.js on localhost:3000
npm run lint  # ESLint
npm run build # production build
```

Drizzle / DB (Postgres):
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db" npm run db:migrate
# To regenerate SQL after schema changes
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db" npm run db:generate
```
- Important: Drizzle only applies migrations listed in `drizzle/meta/_journal.json`. Always commit both the generated SQL files and the updated journal. The init script/CI will fail if a `.sql` migration is not present in the journal.

## 5. Routing & Components
- Public landing page: `app/page.tsx`.
- No route groups exist yet. 
- Keep components server-side by default; add `"use client"` only when required by client hooks/state.

## 6. Styling
- Tailwind is enabled via `app/globals.css` (`@import "tailwindcss";`). There is no standalone `tailwind.config` yet; add one only if needed.
- Limit global styles; prefer component- or route-scoped styles.
- Fonts are loaded through `next/font` (Geist). Keep overrides minimal.
- Landing page uses Panda orange (#FB7232) accents, card-based feature highlights, a gradient hero, and a client-island note panel; buttons and menus wrap on small viewports.

## 7. Environment & Secrets
- Required for AI: set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in ENV
- Database: set `DATABASE_URL` (Postgres).
- Auth: reuse `AUTH_SECRET` as `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` for NextAuth.
- Optional: set `OPENAI_MODEL` to override the default `gpt-4o-mini` used by server helpers.
- Add additional env vars by request users with actions; never commit secrets.

## 8. Data & Backend
- Drizzle + Postgres configured with a base `users` table (email, first/last name, password hash, emailVerified, timestamps).
- Migrations live under `drizzle/` and are run via `npm run db:migrate`.
- When adding routes or server actions, place data helpers under `lib/` and document contracts in FILES.md and RULES.md.

## 9. Server vs Client Components (Guardrails)
- Default to Server Components for files inside `app/`. They may fetch data, access databases, and read env vars, but must not use React hooks or browser APIs.
- Client-only features (React hooks like `useState`/`useEffect`, event handlers like `onClick`/`onSubmit`, browser APIs like `window`/`document`/`localStorage`) must only exist in files that begin with `"use client"`.
- Keep Client Components small and isolated. Example: buttons needing event handlers (Sign Out, form submit, UI interactions) should be small Client Components imported into Server Components.
- Import rules: Server Components can import Client Components; Client Components must not import Server Components.
- Mutations/actions: use Server Actions or API routes; trigger them from a Client Component via forms, event handlers, or helpers (e.g., `signOut()`).
- Security: never expose secrets or server-only logic inside Client Components.
- Quick check: if a file has hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs, add `"use client"` at the top or move that logic into a Client Component.

## 10. Testing (Not Present)
- No tests are included. If adding tests, prefer:
  - Unit: `__tests__/` or co-located `*.test.tsx`
  - E2E: Playwright under `e2e/`
  - Provide lightweight stubs/utilities

## 11. Change Guidelines
- Default to minimal diffs; avoid rewrites.
- Do not move files across route groups without coordination.
- Avoid new Markdown explainer files unless explicitly requested; update existing docs instead.
- Do not introduce time- or randomness-dependent values directly in React render (`Date.now()`, `Math.random()`). Precompute in server components, constants, or `useEffect` if client-only.
- If adding auth, billing, or DB: implement all the changes at once. 
- Only `scripts/error-reporter.ts` may be imported into runtime UI (via `components/ErrorReporter.tsx`); keep other scripts server-only.

## 12. Hard Stops
- Unclear requirements or missing context.
- Requests to alter session/cookie behavior (not present) without approval.
- Hand-editing generated migration SQL without intent (Drizzle migrations are committed; edit cautiously).
- Storing or logging secrets in code or assets.

## 13. Deployment
- Default target: Next.js on Vercel or any Node 18+ host.
- Docker support is not configured. Add a `Dockerfile` only with explicit need and document it.

## 14. Cookie Configuration Rules (Iframe Auth)
- When setting auth/session cookies (session helpers, middleware refresh/cleanup), set `SameSite: "none"`, `secure: true`, `httpOnly: true`, and `path: "/"` so they remain first-party inside iframes (e.g., Bubble embedding).
- Do not alter redirect/guard logic; middleware that deletes/refreshes tokens stays the same—only cookie metadata changes.
- If embedding in another repo/app: ensure iframe host and Next.js app share the same root domain (or use a parent-proxy domain) to keep cookies first-party.
- Avoid client-side cookie hacks; adjust only the server-set cookie options.

Please Operate cautiously, keep changes small, and align new features with the documented structure. When uncertain: **STOP AND ASK**.
